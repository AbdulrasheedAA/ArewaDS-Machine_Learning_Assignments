#Search for a bot

#Instructions
Bots are everywhere. Your assignment: find one and adopt it! You can find them on web sites, in banking applications, and on the phone, for example when you call financial services companies for advice or account information. Analyze the bot and see if you can confuse it. If you can confuse the bot, why do you think that happened? Write a short paper about your experience.



## Abstract:
In this experiment, the Zenith Bank ZiVa chatbot was adopted and analyzed to assess its effectiveness in handling user queries and requests. The experiment aimed to evaluate the bot's ability to understand and respond to various types of inputs, including ambiguous pronouns, semantic contradictions, and non-sequitur statements. Through a series of interactions with the chatbot, its responses were scrutinized to determine whether it could be confused or misled. The findings of the experiment shed light on the bot's limitations and implications for its practical use in customer service applications.

## Methodology:
The experiment involved interacting with the Zenith Bank ZiVa chatbot via WhatsApp. Various types of inputs were provided to the bot to test its responses to different types of questions, requests, and scenarios. The chatbot was programmed to assist customers with general inquiries about account information, transactions, and basic banking services. Initially, the bot responded promptly and accurately to straightforward questions, providing relevant information in a clear and concise manner.

However, as I attempted to confuse the bot by asking ambiguous or complex questions, its responses became less accurate and sometimes irrelevant. For example, when I asked, "Can i transfer in foreign currency?" the bot provided a generic response about the bank's transfer services without addressing the specific question about foreign transaction. Similarly, when I inquired about the nearest branch to me, the bot gave addresses in Jos, Kaduna, Abuja rather than providing locations in Lagos.

## Discussion:
The limitations observed in the chatbot's performance can be attributed to several factors:

- Limited Understanding: Chatbots rely on pre-defined rules and machine learning algorithms to understand user queries. While they can handle simple and common questions effectively, they may struggle with complex or ambiguous inquiries that deviate from their programmed scope.

- Lack of Context: Chatbots often lack contextual understanding, making it challenging for them to grasp the intent behind user queries accurately. Without sufficient context, they may provide generic responses or fail to address the user's specific needs.

- Inflexibility: Chatbots are designed to follow predefined paths and scripts, limiting their ability to adapt to unexpected or unconventional user inputs. When faced with unfamiliar scenarios or questions outside their predefined scope, they may resort to generic responses or refer users to human agents.

## Conclusion:
While chatbots offer significant benefits in automating customer support and enhancing user experience, they also have inherent limitations that affect their performance. Through this analysis, it becomes evident that chatbots excel in handling routine inquiries but struggle with complex or ambiguous questions that require contextual understanding and nuanced responses. As such, organizations deploying chatbots should recognize their capabilities and limitations and supplement them with human support when necessary to ensure a seamless customer experience. Additionally, ongoing advancements in AI and NLP technologies may address some of these limitations, leading to more sophisticated and capable chatbots in the future.
